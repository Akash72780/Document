Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my ability to design, develop and monitor robust and scalable software solutions. My proficiency in Java, SpringBoot and Python has allowed me to build elegant code that meets performance and security standards. Additionally, my experience in AWS cloud services, encompassing EC2, Lambda, S3 buckets, CloudFormation, IOT Core, DynamoDB and more, has empowered me to build and optimize cloud-native applications that drive efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
